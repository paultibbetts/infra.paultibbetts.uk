<FileTree>

- terraform/ automation tool
  - dns.tf configures Network
  - web.tf configures Hardware
- ansible/  automation tool
  - site.yaml configures Software
- .ci/ Continuous Integration
  - workflows/ that run when code changes
- Makefile task runner
- scripts/ ran by CI workflows
  - deploy.sh Continuous Deployment

My infrastructure is written down as code, called "Infrastructure as Code".

import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<LinkCard title="Why Infrastructure as Code?" href="/decisions/why-iac/" />

I use [Terraform](/automation/terraform) to configure hardware and [Ansible](/automation/ansible) to configure software.

Continuous Integration is used by each site to run its deployment script when it gets updated, which gives me [Continuous Deployment](/automation/cd).
