import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Continuous Integration is used to run a deploy script for each web site hosted by the server,
which gives me Continuous Deployment.

## GitHub Actions

The code for my sites is hosted on GitHub, where I can use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for Continuous Integration.

GitHub Actions is used to run a workflow when the site is updated.

The workflow that runs when this site is updated is:

import githubWorkflowDeploy from '/../.github/workflows/deploy.yaml?raw';

<Code code={githubWorkflowDeploy} lang="yaml" title=".github/workflows/deploy.yaml" />

which builds the site and runs `docs/scripts/deploy.sh` whenever the `main` branch is updated.

## Deploy script

A shell script deploys the generated site to the web server:

import deployScript from '/scripts/deploy.sh?raw';

<Code code={deployScript} lang="sh" title="scripts/deploy.sh" />
