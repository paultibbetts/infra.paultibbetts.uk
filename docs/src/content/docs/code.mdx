import { Card } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Card title="GitHub" icon="github">View the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/paultibbetts/infra.paultibbetts.uk).</Card>

<Card title="Gitea" icon="seti:git">A backup copy is kept on my NAS in my homelab.</Card>

I'm thinking about making my homelab Gitea instance public, so I don't have such a reliance on GitHub, but I need to use GitHub for the Terraform provider to work.
