title: Why Infrastructure as Code?
description: Why I used IaC for a personal website.
---

I'm a professional web developer and I learnt Infrastructure as Code many years ago.

When it came to my personal website I set it up the same way I'd set up any other.

## Recoverability

My site's currently hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4. I don't know everything about servers but I do know most of them aren't Raspberry Pis.

Whilst I have full confidence in it working, if it should break my setup is now fully recoverable in a few minutes.

And I wouldn't have to do much clicking, it would all be done by one or two commands.

## Explainability

Every decision and every part of my infrastructure now lives in version control, not in a control panel.

I can see all the parts that go into it, no matter how complicated it ends up being.

## Confidence changing it

I've got a setup that seems to be working, so if I ever break it I can roll back to this version to get it up and running again.

## Independence

Seeing all the resources that make up my website laid out in code makes it easier to swap them out for alternatives.

I'm not locked in to providers I can replace in less than ten lines of code.
