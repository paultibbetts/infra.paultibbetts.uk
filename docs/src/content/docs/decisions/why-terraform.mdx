title: Why Terraform?
description: Answsering why I use Terraform.
---

I learnt [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) years ago, before the licensing problem that made [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/), which I am still yet to try.

I use it to provision the physical part of the infrastructure that makes up a web project.

It works like a state machine, where it translates what you wrote down into the API commands to run with your specified provider to get you those things.

## Reproducible

There are a few things that go into my website, and now they're all laid out in code.

In theory I can run

```sh
terraform apply
```

and my infrastructure will end up as what I wrote down.

## Version controlled

As code I get the benefits of keeping the current state of my infrastructure in version control:

- pull requests for changes
- history of changes
- [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
- an audit trail

## All in one place

I set some of my infrastructure up years ago and had forgotten I needed so many TXT records on my domain.

It wasn't until I checked to write this that I realised I had so many.

Keeping my setup in one place helps me keep an eye on it all.
