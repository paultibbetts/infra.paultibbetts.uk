title: Why Ansible?
description: Answering why I use Ansible.
---

[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) is my prefered way of configuring software on bare metal machines.

## It uses SSH

Ansible uses SSH, which is already installed, so I find it easier to work
with than alternatives that need an agent on the server.

## Idempotency

Ansible is _idempotent_ meaning it (should) always end up as what you wrote down, every time.

## It handles secrets

[ansible-vault](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-vault.html) means I can leave secrets in code next to where they get used.
