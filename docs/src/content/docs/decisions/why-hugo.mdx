title: Why Hugo?
description: Answering why I use Hugo.
---

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is the static site generator that powers my site.

As a SSG it turns my markdown content into HTML, and that makes it replaceable.

I like using it, and it's working great, so I have no desire to change it for something else,
but it's good to know ultimately I'm not stuck with it.

My infrastructure is set up to host static HTML content, so as long as I use a tool to turn my markdown into HTML it 
doesn't matter if it's Hugo or anything else.

## Why I picked Hugo

I picked it mainly because I had signed up to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) and they use it.

People are [still switching to it](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/migrated-to-hugo/).

## Why not ...

I've [tried a few static site generators](https://paultibbetts.uk/changelog#2022-2025).

The days of my personal site being a playground are over.

I now like boring. 

And stable. 

Hugo is both.
