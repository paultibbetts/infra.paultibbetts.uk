title: Why not Infrastructure as Code?
description: Why you might not want to use IaC.

I use IaC, but it's not right for everyone.

## Takes too much time

Writing the code to set up your infrastructure takes much more time than clicking that button in the web interface
and moving on to the next task. It takes more time than writing down what you just did in your notes.

I think the benefits are worth the extra time.

## It's a new thing to learn

I completely agree with this. I used it because I'm used to using it, but for a small personal site like this I
wouldn't spend any [innovation tokens](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) on learning how to do IaC.

If you are interested in learning IaC a personal site is the best place to start.

## There's a steep learning curve

IaC like my setup involves not one new tool but two, and knowledge gained from over a decade's experience working for the web.

The benefits may be worth it but for a personal site they involve too much up-front work.
