description: The hardware I use for my website infrastructure.

My site is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4 from [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/) that is located in London, UK.

There is no good reason for this, I just thought it would be cool.

## Role

The Pi hosts multiple sites and their assets.

It also manages the TLS certificates for each site.

## Storage

The Pi only has Network File Storage, which means it's not great for running Docker containers.

Because of this I run the web server as a binary. NFS is fine for serving static files.

## IPv6-only network

The Pi is on an IPv6-only network and this means users on IPv4-only networks cannot reach it.

I use an IPv4 - IPv6 proxy to make the Pi reachable to all users.
